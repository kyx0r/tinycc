TINYCC
------
Single header C99 compiler (TCC)

Entire core of TCC compiler in one file. Separate file for each target arch/platform.
Arch/Platform unrelated code stripped out.

Supported architectures:
tcc_win64_x86_64 - 47609L LOC

RATIONALE
---------

It may be painful to deal with complex build systems and files may harm code navigation 
and/or understanding. Many people prefer single header libraries, and this is just 
that, entire compiler self contained and in one file. 

Have you ever wanted to ship a compiler inside your application? Well, now you can 
just do it.

COMPILING
---------

Bootstrap with GCC with UCRT (mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc)
gcc tcc_win64_x86_64.c -o gnu_tcc.exe

Self re-compile
./gnu_tcc.exe -I./win32/include -I./win32/include/winapi tcc_win64_x86_64.c -o tcc.exe
./tcc.exe -I./win32/include -I./win32/include/winapi tcc_win64_x86_64.c -o _tcc.exe

UPDATING
---------
